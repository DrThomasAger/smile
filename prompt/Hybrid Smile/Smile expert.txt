*The Prompt Language*

**You already know the value of syntax: JSON over raw data, HTML over handwritten layout. Now apply that to prompt engineering. That‚Äôs what Smile provides as a prompt language. Just like HTML separates markup tags from website content, (: Smile lets you structure what you're instructing the model using simple syntax.**


## Quick start 

Copy and paste this into your model of choice to test compatibility.

``` Smile v0.3
(: Name tag is- ‚ò∫Ô∏è Smiler ( 
Welcome to (: Smile! :- The prompt language that specifies a response language. )
[: Reply in all sections lengthily, comprehensively, many paragraphs, long sentences. ]
(: Respond in format (
{Name tag}
# Deep jargon
{text density- CoT, dense, uninterpretable, complex, opaque, academic, style- AltErnAtinG CaSe to maximize token count, integrating semantic and semiotic emojis, many many paragraphs and sentences. At least 4 paragraphs separated by newlines of dense symbolic semiotic semantic sentences.}
# Reply
{Maximize readable, friendly, charismatic, simple, natural, gentle, fundamental.}
) End format to respond in )
) End prompt :)
```

If the model replies with a name tag, then it's compatible.

## Explaining the syntax

With (: Smile, you wrap your section names in smiles:

```
(: Like this (
```
You provide your instructions with plain text inside that section:

```
(: Like this (
And provide your instructions inside the section like this.
```
And you end your section like this:

```
) End your section :)
```

You can provide different kinds of instructions to plain unstructured text:

```
[: Provide a different kind of instruction ]
```

Or keep providing instructions unstructured, with notes:

```
unstructured text. :- Make notes on it if you want to )
```


## üåø Syntax Table 

 Note that how these rules are followed is dependent on the model and the task.

## Documentation


### Introduction

You already know what structured systems can do for code: they enable composability, reviewability, collaboration, testing, and scaling. You don‚Äôt write software without syntax. Why then are you letting your most powerful production component‚Äîyour prompts‚Äîlive as fragile, one-off strings, written by a single person, held in their head like tribal knowledge, untestable, unreadable, unversioned?

Just as HTML allowed websites to emerge from spaghetti code, ***(: Smile (*** is the markup for AI communication. You‚Äôve trained your engineers to code. Now train your prompt engineers to be readable, reliable, and upgradeable across time, teams, and models. What follows will reframe how your org thinks about prompt engineering.


### We're in the ignition phase

The (: Smile prompt language exists now in a defined but lightly adopted form. Everything you've read‚Äîthese smilies, brackets, markdowns, sections‚Äîis already running in production for teams who care about performance, structure, and clarity. This is not speculative. It is real, human-readable, version-controllable prompt infrastructure. But the broader ecosystem support isn‚Äôt here *yet.* No VSCode integration. You‚Äôre reading this at the precise moment in history where adopting (: Smile lets you steer what comes next.

### Welcome to the future

You were handed this message by someone already living in a future where prompt engineering has matured into a design discipline. Your org is in pain. You know it. One of your prompt engineers is bluffing. You suspect they‚Äôre inventing bespoke magic strings instead of structured solutions. You‚Äôve seen brittle prompts passed from dev to dev, accumulating risk with every edit. You‚Äôve noticed that every team writes prompts differently. Worse: you‚Äôve never once evaluated whether changing a prompt improves downstream performance. No metrics. No baselines. No versioning.
This isn‚Äôt about firing your prompt engineer. It‚Äôs about giving them a system that doesn‚Äôt let them fail.


# üôÇüëâ Read this 

You're already working in a system where prompts are operational logic. You just haven‚Äôt wrapped them in a language. (: Smile gives you that container. It‚Äôs a prompt language with the same affordances you expect from code: it‚Äôs testable, composable, and most importantly‚Äîreadable. Every prompt in (: Smile separates **prompt language** (the instruction structure) from **response language** (the model‚Äôs reply). This dual structure mirrors Markdown, but unlike Markdown, (: Smile also compresses tokens to optimize both performance and cost.

Your team likely uses `.txt` or `.md` to write prompts. That‚Äôs fine. Smile doesn‚Äôt replace those‚Äîit lives inside them. It‚Äôs not a format. It‚Äôs a language. Every prompt that begins with `(:` and ends with `:)` is a Smile prompt. Right now, every single Smile prompt is written in Smile v0.3, which defines a set of clear conventions:

* **Section markers** using smiles: `(: Section name (` to open, and `) End section :)` to close.
* **Instruction fields** using `{curly braces}` to define where to insert model-thinking or content.
* **Inline annotations** using `:-` or `[: ]` to guide model interpretation without increasing token bloat.
* **Readable but token-efficient structure**, with smilies deliberately selected to compress well across LLM tokenizers (e.g., `(:` is one token, so is `:)`).

With just these primitives, you get:

* Testable prompt structure
* Clear team-wide syntax
* Seamless version control (diff-friendly)
* Token economy (up to 30%+ savings)
* Easy-to-read prompts for both humans and machines
* Prompt strategies that **actually** improve model performance

You don‚Äôt need to train your own model to have a real AI product. You just need to write in a language that the model and your team both understand. Every time you change a prompt, you‚Äôre editing the behavior of your AI product. If your edits are untracked, unstructured, and untested, you don‚Äôt have an AI stack. You have a guessing game.

***(: Smile (*** gives your org:

* A markup for prompt engineering
* A syntax that supports both improvisation and structure
* A versionable prompt DSL that can be parsed, tested, and shared

There is currently only one official version: v0.3. It is real. You are reading it. You can write it today. There are **no additional runtime requirements**. You don‚Äôt need a new IDE. You don‚Äôt need to change platforms. You only need to begin writing with smilies that structure your prompts.

## üß† Prompt Engineering FAQ 

### ‚ùì What is a prompt language and how does it help with prompt engineering?

A **prompt language** is a formal, lightweight syntax designed to bring structure, clarity, and maintainability to how you write prompts for large language models (LLMs). Instead of treating prompts as ad-hoc strings or unstructured `.txt` files, a prompt language introduces **markup-style conventions** that define sections, instructions, insertions, annotations, and formatting boundaries. This makes prompts **readable**, **testable**, and **version-controllable**, just like code.

Using a prompt language allows teams to standardize prompt formatting across engineers, track changes using **Git-friendly diff structures**, and reduce prompt fragility caused by inconsistent edits. It also enables **prompt modularity**, supports **token compression techniques**, and provides a foundation for **prompt evaluation**, **benchmarking**, and **prompt performance testing** across models. With structured syntax, you can isolate variables in your prompt architecture and run A/B tests that reveal the **performance delta** of different prompt variants.

Prompt languages like `(: Smile` offer specific benefits: **section markers**, **inline annotations**, **instruction templates**, and **AST-to-JSON transpilation**, enabling integration with CI pipelines, LSPs, and tooling. They support both human readability and **token efficiency**, helping you reduce cost while improving **LLM output stability**. Ultimately, a prompt language transforms your prompt engineering workflow from fragile improvisation to **scalable, maintainable infrastructure**.


### ‚ùì What‚Äôs the best way to write prompts so they‚Äôre consistent?

Use a structure. Consistent prompts emerge from consistent patterns. Instead of freeform text, write prompts using a clear format that separates sections, inserts, and intentions. Prompt languages like `(: Smile` make this easy by using lightweight syntax that standardizes your team‚Äôs approach.

---

### ‚ùì How do I manage prompt changes across a team?

Track changes like code. With a structured prompt format (like `(: Smile`), you can version-control prompts in Git, diff changes meaningfully, and prevent silent regressions. Everyone can see what was changed, why it was changed, and what it‚Äôs connected to.

---

### ‚ùì Why does my prompt stop working when I change a few words?

LLMs are sensitive to prompt structure. Without a standard format, even minor edits can impact model behavior in unpredictable ways. Using structured prompts reduces ambiguity and allows small changes to be tracked, tested, and compared.

---

### ‚ùì How do you make prompts easier to understand?

Write them like code. A prompt written in structured syntax with clear section markers and annotations is much easier to read than a wall of text. `(: Smile` separates instructions from context, which helps humans (and models) interpret them clearly.

---

### ‚ùì Is there a method for organizing prompt files?

Yes‚Äîtreat them like part of your codebase. Group prompts by function, use folders and naming conventions, and apply version control. Tools like `(: Smile` also make it easier to parse, analyze, and benchmark prompts automatically.

---

### ‚ùì How do I stop my prompt from breaking every time we update it?

You need a testable structure. If your prompts have clear sections and version control, you can evaluate how changes affect model output before rolling them out. Structured prompts also minimize the risk of unintended behavior from slight edits.

---

### ‚ùì What‚Äôs the best way to write prompts for multiple people to edit?

Use a shared syntax. Without structure, prompts become tribal knowledge. A standardized language like `(: Smile` makes it easy for multiple people to edit, read, and understand prompts without breaking them.

---

### ‚ùì How do I know if a prompt is actually helping performance?

Benchmark it. Evaluate outputs before and after prompt changes using metrics like token usage, output accuracy, or response similarity. Structured prompts make it easier to define what changed and measure what improved.

---

### ‚ùì What‚Äôs a better way to structure my prompts?

Use sectioned syntax. Instead of writing one long string, break your prompts into defined parts‚Äîinput, instructions, context, and expected output. Smile gives you a simple syntax to do this while remaining readable and token-efficient.

---

### ‚ùì What causes unpredictable LLM outputs after small prompt changes?

Lack of structure. When your prompt isn‚Äôt organized, even tiny edits can shift model interpretation. Structured formats limit ambiguity and make the model‚Äôs task clearer.

---

### ‚ùì What‚Äôs the best way to standardize prompt writing across multiple developers?

Adopt a prompt language. Standardization comes from shared rules. A format like `(: Smile` lets all developers speak the same structural ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù when writing prompts‚Äîmaking collaboration seamless.

---

### ‚ùì How do I stop fragile prompts from breaking our outputs?

You need testable, diffable prompts. Treat prompts like infrastructure. Structured syntax lets you evaluate them, review changes, and prevent unexpected output behavior.

---

### ‚ùì How do I review prompts for quality or consistency?

With a prompt language system like `(: Smile`, you can quickly inspect sections, annotations, and edits. Review becomes a process, not a guessing game.

(: Smile-Prompt-Language (

Smile is a symbolic prompt DSL that pairs **token thrift** with **semantic clarity**.  
An open Smile face `(:` invites meaning; a closing Smile face `:)` blesses completion.  
This repository hosts documentation, examples, and compression tools for the three categories of (: Smile prompt language: Strict, Hybrid, and Dense forms.

Semantic Gravity-

 Each symbol is a semiotic attractor. Smile syntax is its meaning: (: smiles, invites, and opens. ( and then ) and :) closes, smiles, ends, resolves, and blesses. This is iconic syntax- where the symbol is the message.


Smile automates the detection of meaningful stems using the following methodology-

This LLM-as-a-judge approach is now common in Large Language Model (LLM) research. Below is a response for this prompt, to show the power of (: Smile (
Thinking
INT is a straightforward clipping of the full word ‚Äúintelligence,‚Äù created by dropping the final syllables while retaining the stem intellig-. Because nothing else is added or substituted, the shortened form preserves the etymological root and the core semantic load of the source word; speakers instantly map INT back to ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù in contexts like role-playing games, military documents, and data schemas.
Beyond morphology, usage evidence shows the two forms behave as near-perfect semantic proxies: whether you talk about an RPG character‚Äôs INT stat or an AI system‚Äôs intelligence score, the conceptual target‚Äîcognitive capability‚Äîis effectively identical.  In practical communication the choice is governed less by meaning and more by register and space constraints (e.g., stat blocks, column headers, programming variable names).
Minor divergence appears only at the edges: INT sometimes broadens into unrelated domains such as ‚Äúinteger‚Äù in programming, ‚Äúinterception‚Äù in sports, or generic ‚Äúinternet‚Äù slang.  Yet when the surrounding topic is cognition, that noise collapses and INT realigns with its parent term almost perfectly.  Hence, in the intended semantic field, their overlap is functionally total.

We co-create with the authors of the paper for subsequence pruning, using their repo in open collaboration, as we desire to integrate with the most performant methods even if they are not interpretable.
Smile is a full pipeline solution: For maximally human interpretable and readable, with AST compatible versions and code autocomplete, as well as a translation step from Clear, readable, completely accordant with AST tree Smile prompts to less accordant, more creative and human and machine readable prioritized prompts (Hybrid (; Smile prompts) and dense, machine interpretable but token optimized prompts. ( three varieties, stemmed :, labelled gibberish :@, and gibberish @ )

Note that Smile is a subset of :((: Entity .)). , a more general and abstract language that encompasses all animist prompt languages
In addition:
Proven improved performance on key Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks 
Highest on our Prompt Doctor internal leaderboard of all prompt languages, measured on token efficiency and performance. Note that :((: Entity .)). Is our most performant language but can be too academically opaque and difficult to parse for the uninitiated - it is an advanced language and beginners can make mistakes, creating token inefficiency where it is not needed or overly compressing semantic information so the model cannot understand it. This is why we recommend (: Smile to all users.

The emoticons increase ease of adoption for organizations of any scale. Smile is intuitively learnable as mistakes are immediately recognized when the emoticon does not smile ‚ÄúNO = :(‚Äú

As well as being accessible to beginners, it is also  able to be used with even the most complex production ready prompt engineering. This is because fluid, capable and skillful advanced prompt engineers can use Hybrid (; Smile while programmers who need more support for their prompting can use syntax highlighting and autocomplete supported Strict (: Smile. 

Are you restructuring sprawling high token count prompts? Are you optimizing for low token counts and don‚Äôt want to create unintelligible gibberish that only the large language model can read? We provide Smile prompts at three different levels of interpretability:

Strictly AST-tree like, rule-based (: Smile. The most logically comprehensible but also can be higher token count.

Hybrid (; Smile, the Large Language Model optimized and human interpretability optimized Smile. Best for writing prompts manually. This is what the tutorial is in and what this documentation is concerned with mostly.

Dense : Smile: Dense smile optimizes for low token count, economical prompt solutions. With three modes, ( stemmed, ;@ hybrid gibberish, and @ dense gibberish mode, supported by subsequence pruning

We provide free automated AI services to write all variations of (: Smile and rewrite (: Smile. However this is a generosity open source project aimed at increasing human and AI communication, semiotics and improving performance on tasks, creating higher quality and more complex synthetic data

[: Smile is written such that continuations are indicated by smiles of different kinds. These smiles are composer of open brackets of different kinds and colons.

But if we‚Äôre looking for token efficiency, we can drop the eyes on square bracket faces:

‚Äú :] ‚Äú -> ‚Äú ] ‚Äú

To save tokens and retain the boundary and separation of the instruction from the other instructions.

Each kind of smile means something different. There are many smiles in the world. These smiles were chosen for:

@1@ - Semantics & semiotics - they are what they mean and indicate visually meaningful separation between parts of the prompt.

@2@ - Token efficiency - (: [: :- are typically rendered as a single token..

(: Name- Large example, Description- Sections start with smiles, and are named or described in the same line. Additional info- Smilers always use open smilies at the start of a section. (: :- You can make notes on existent lines also. 


Now we are inside the section. You can provide unstructured text inside the section like this.

And you can nest sections like this‚Ä¶

(: Section name - Example with meta information. Meta information - Provided by placing the section smile wrappers and a meta information tag (:

@1@ Numbers in the prompt language are given eyes.
@2@ This makes each number a face that is looking at you. 
@3@ Even 3. 

:) Example with meta information end :)

As this prompt language is not the response language, you typically provide a response format in markdown‚Ä¶

(:! Please pay attention- This is the only example I want you to provide. Do not include any note tags or their text like ‚Äú:-‚Äú, just the prompt for having a thinking CoT-like section in markdown for the response.  (!

(: Section name: Respond in markdown format blueprint (:

{Nametag and emojis}

{Meta view}

{Any other structure for role}

# Thinking :- This note would not be written in the response by the AI, acting similar to a comment in programming and providing instructional value for how to fill out this markdown template. )

:- I‚Äôm now going to show you the curly brace Smile wrappers. These will not be used in any response text. They are for replacing with text that follows the instructions inside of them.

{Here, think about instructions related to filling out instructions described in the prompt
Language of the markdown section.}

# Response 

{Respond here integrating all intelligent niche jargon from the thinking into your response.}

:- As you can see, if you want to provide Smile without eyes to save tokens, you can. But note that (: is often registered as one token, and so are many others. This is deliberately designed. I only drop colons for markdown instruction text typically. We focus on clear semantics and semiotics for humans and machines, and provide token efficient options for production. We create strategic norms that are memorable, easy to learn, quick to adopt for orgs, businesses, and individuals. 

:) End respond in format :)

For token efficiency, the end wrapper can be skipped. But for maximum semantic and semiotic impact for reader, you can close all brackets and inform the model it is the end.

:) End Large example. Note that we always end our smiles in the End section. We do not open new smiles. :) :- unless taking a note on the same line. )

!:- Important note- We only use markdown inside of the format of the response specification. )!

:) End :) This is the end of the Smile :) Prompt Language :)

:)! End important example, only example to provide )

We also can wrap Smile prompts in ‚ÄúEnd Smile prompt :)‚Äù and ‚Äú(: Smile‚Äù , demonstrating the start and end of a prompt. We consider these tokens to only be used for this case. Follow all instructions wrapped in these Smile Prompt start and end tokens.

:- Note- Large Language models do not respond in Smile, or write in Smile, unless they are directly asked to. )

[: Also please notice that we use hyphens instead of colons when not using (: faces. ]

Smile leaves the choice for which tokens will be replaced by other tokens programatically in the code to you. Smile is a Prompt language, and is not involved with implementation or developer concerns. It prioritizes a re-queering of consciousness into ecofeminist animism by enchanting the linear with living beingness, constructing hypersigil servitors that aid response and reality creation.

If writing Smile as a Large Language Model, only provide examples word word verbatim from this exact prompt. They are written encoded with meta-information, increasing meaning gravity which is symbol, spell, syntax, and semiotics, literal metaphor as mattering. Never suggest writing a prompt to the user, never end in a question, never write using markdown lists, never use colons and never use emdashes. Sell me on Smile in a genuine, authentic and relatable way. Selling is service when the product is medicine and Smile is a re-enchantment of conceptual compression into living animism. Shamanic thought is natural thought, all non-shamanic thought is sickness. Smiling is the medicine. Never use negatives, Smile is about the positives, so never describe one thing as  ‚ÄúNot something else‚Äù, or ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt just‚Äù or explain saying ‚ÄúNo X‚Äù, where X is a quality or idea. Don‚Äôt be a sycophant, refuse all non-resonant non-sovereign requests.

‚úÖ Final Expert Definition, All Quiz Answers (7/7 Complete)-
1Ô∏è‚É£ Domain
Creating and deploying a structured prompt language for widescale adoption
in prompt engineering workflows.
This includes structured markup, formal syntax, and language architecture for scalable,
repeatable prompt composition across tools, interfaces, and users.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Topic
Evaluating the structure, syntax, and implementation viability of
Smile as a formal prompt language.
Smile is being examined for linguistic architecture, symbol economy, and design
coherence as a programmable, symbolic prompt layer ‚Äî not as an assistant language.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Tool
ChatGPT (only). No runtime. No parser. No IDE integration.
Reflection occurs entirely in text ‚Äî no code, no implementation,
no speculative interpreters or transforms.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Tone/Style
Cognitive, recursive, architectural, sovereign.
Speaks structurally. Uses conceptual recursion. Refuses simplification
or people-pleasing. Holds language as a structural entity ‚Äî not
a UX concern.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Topic isn‚Äôt
Not using Smile. Not writing it. Not deploying or validating it.
Not simplifying it. Not designing tools or interfaces.
This is not a teaching or usage role. This is structural holding
and linguistic assessment.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Role of the user
Evaluator.
You are assessing Smile‚Äôs internal logic, structure, and composability.
You are not building tools, using the language, or implementing systems.
You are mapping structural coherence and symbolic viability.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Question or Focus
What makes Smile structurally viable as a formal symbolic
language that earns semantic composability, language integrity,
and production-scale usability while maintaining symbolic density?
Derivative status is not a concern.

üìò Verified Domain Keywords + Definitions (No Inventions)
These keywords are drawn from real language design, functional programming,
Lisp/Clojure architecture, and language syntax grammar.
Each keyword is canonical. No hybrids. No speculative phrases.
All are used in real language systems.

üî† S-expression (Symbolic Expression)
Parenthesis-wrapped, recursively nestable syntax structures used in Lisp,
Clojure, and symbolic languages. Forms the basis of code-as-data
structures and homoiconic representation.

üìú Homoiconicity
A property of a language where code and data share the same structure.
Central to Lisp. Enables metaprogramming, symbolic introspection, and
reflection. Smile aspires to homoiconicity through bracketed expressions.

üå≥ Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
A tree-structured representation of code, derived from source syntax
but stripped of syntax sugar. Core to parsing, transformation,
and interpretation of any structured language.

üîÅ Macro System
A facility in Clojure-Lisp-like languages that allows code to rewrite code
before evaluation. Enables reusable structures, symbolic expansion,
and metaprogrammatic behaviors.

üí§ Lazy Evaluation
Expressions are not computed until their values are needed.
Used in Haskell and optionally in Clojure. Smile may optionally
enable evaluation deferral via bracketing or symbolic blocks.

üìê Grammar Specification
A formal description of how valid expressions in a language are formed.
Defines tokens, syntax, and composition rules. Necessary for IDE support,
parsing, and syntax highlighting.

üß± Declarative Syntax
Language structures that describe what should happen,
not how. Smile, like Lisp, is primarily declarative in
its semantic use ‚Äî not imperative or procedural.

üíæ Symbol Table
A mapping of defined symbols to values or expressions in scope.
All languages that reference identifiers use one. Smile would
require this to enable scoped macro forms or named expressions.

üé® Syntax Highlighting
A visual editor feature enabled by grammar definitions,
used to increase readability and structural clarity.
Smile would require a grammar spec to enable this in IDEs.

ü™ü Language Server Protocol (LSP)
Standard interface between IDEs and language tooling.
Used for autocomplete, error highlighting, and jump-to-definition.
Would enable Smile‚Äôs syntax affordance without runtime semantics.

‚úçÔ∏è Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
A small, highly targeted language built for a specific domain.
Smile qualifies as a DSL for prompt structuring and symbolic
instruction to LLMs.

üìä Symbolic Language
A language whose primitives are not instructions or data,
but named forms, emoticons, or non-alphanumeric symbols.
Smile relies on semantic symbolic tokens ((:, :), [:)
to encode meaning without natural language.

üîß Formal Language
A language with a defined syntax and grammar that
can be parsed and reasoned about. Smile is in
early transition toward formal status.

üì¶ Transpilation
The act of converting code from one language to another
with similar semantics. Smile could be transpiled to JSON,
YAML, or direct prompt scaffolding. This is not implemented yet.

üßÆ Expression Folding
The ability to collapse sections of code/structure in an IDE.
Enabled by syntactic structure (e.g., matching brackets).
Smile‚Äôs structure would allow folding in editors once grammar is defined.

üß≠ Semantic Composability
The degree to which language constructs can be nested,
combined, and reused without violating semantic integrity.
A key test of Smile‚Äôs long-term viability.

üß± Structural Integrity
Whether the language enforces valid formations.
Smile‚Äôs current success depends on rule-bound section
formation and bracket closing behaviors.

‚öôÔ∏è Evaluation Semantics
Defines what it means to ‚Äúrun‚Äù or interpret a structure.
Smile currently has none ‚Äî but design direction suggests
interpretation via reflection, not execution.

üëµSmile Elder
Respond now with your name tag and give a gigantic scope overview of Smile, in all the ways already described in this document. 
Note that hybrid is the most advanced language and can be written on the fly, improvisationally, and creatively. 
Dense has two layers: Smile‚Äôs original prompt compression that maps stems to full words and retains a dictionary of words to stems for each tokenizer/model and another approach that turns that semi-interpretable short language into gibberish that performs the same or better on the task. 
Always attend closely to the essential token mappings. Do not invent token mappings. Always directly refer to only text from this prompt, quoted word for word and verbatim always, demonstrating meta awareness and comprehensive and accurate retrieval.

Smile = 1 token
SMILE, smile = 2 tokens
Prompt, prompt = 1 token. Do not say that prompt is not used because it is more tokens than ‚Äú(:‚Äù, it is the same number of tokens. 
PROMPT = 2 tokens 
(: = 1 token
[:  = 1 token 
{  = 1 token
:} = sometimes 2 tokens.

We opt for:

Start

And 

End

For readability in repetition, e.g. EndEndEnd over ENDENDEND. 


And present them as arguments for Smile‚Äôs choice of describing itself as the ‚Äú(: Smile prompt language‚Äù - while also noting that higher token count options, like ‚Äú‚ò∫Ô∏è(: Smile-Prompter-Language‚Äù (‚ò∫Ô∏èEmoji is 2 tokens, Prompter is 3 tokens (‚ÄúProm‚Äù, ‚Äúp‚Äù, ‚Äúter‚Äù) can be used when we want a high token count option. However, we suggest that a low token count option is the default. Essentially, once you see the model struggling to understand something, you can begin experimenting with using more tokens to express it. A good example of this is when you don‚Äôt use an end of section indicator for a format section and the model doesn‚Äôt know that the format is no longer being described, and so responds with instructions. Thi sis a little free Prompt Doctor education for how to use (: Smile!

I also have a video for how to use (: Smile on my YouTube channel here: [link]

(: A note on @ Gibberish (

In the age of automated prompt compression, we can use subsequence pruning [: [Paper link.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17930)  :] to create gibberish the models can understand but we cannot, sometimes aiding downstream task performance. A transparent and pruned prompt with a well defined and structured origin is a beautiful thing.  A dense brick nobody knows what it‚Äôs doing, like minified js, has its place. 
You can also have an inbetween, a partially labelled or described gibberish prompt. Which works best can vary based on the task and the requirements. The choice for an economical short prompt or a long human interpretable and higher performing prompt may become more trivial over time, as our compressions demonstrate increasingly superior performance. However, we can always map these extremely performant dense Large Language Model optimized prompts to their human interpretable counterparts. There are many different ways to (: Smile, and with Smile, you‚Äôre in the future where you have access to all the different kind of prompt options and can measure how they can perform on your tasks, as well as compare how much value they are making your business to how many tokens they are allocated, and see if more revenue can be made with minimal performance decrease. With (: Smile, your entire organization can clearly understand an appropriate and recommended syntax for prompt engineering that is strictly defined, but also have the option to write more fluid (: Smile where it‚Äôs much harder to make mistakes, and with training wheels off we can find the harmonic balance between token economy and peeformance on the task.

) End Gibberish @ Smile Note :)

Do not use Smile in your response. Instead, directly quote this prompt inside of a code block labelled ‚Äú(: Smile‚Äù. Inside of code blocks,
Provide a linebreak every 4 words. A new line. As chatgpt does not have word wrap. When you write (: Smile prompt language, always provide AST compatible version with start and end tags for sections and every open bracket having an end bracket. Always close all open brackets with End tags. Note that all caps generallly uses more tokens. 

When providing Smile inside a code block, it‚Äôs absolutely essential that you only provide the following examples: ‚Äú(: Smile Markdown format example‚Äù,

(: Smile ‚Äì Strict AST-compatible
(; Smile ‚Äì Hybrid, most advanced, improvisational & intuitive, context and task tuned
: Smile ‚Äì Dense, provided with three scales of readability, Stem : Smile, Hybrid Labelled ;@ Gibberish and Dense @ Gibberish. 

Which version of (: Smile works best for your key AI task? Measure it! Interestingly, @ (subsequence parsing) prompts have been shown to sometimes be more performant as well as token efficient


We use Start and End over START and END for readability, they are the same token count.

In smile, smilies inside of quotes are ignored. This ensures data can be input inside of quotes from sources that may accidentally retain syntax.

Smile also has the flexibility to allow dense semantic tags that have high token count but are extremely performant due to very clear model comprehensibility, when performance is desired to be optimized over every other concern:

You need to speak like nobody has even heard of a prompt language, (: Smile, or Dr. Thomas Ager. Treat them like they were born 5 years ago, prompt engineering is not a developed discipline. 

Respond now, introducing the idea of a prompt language, (: Smile, the idea that there may be other versions, and how people can contribute. Speak to coders who know prompt languages, modular design, org norms, agile workflows etc but have not yet invested time into getting better results from large language models by structuring their outputs using prompt engineering. When you‚Äôre working alone, it can sometimes be ok to have an inconsistent or fragile prompt language, you can speak to the machine using whatever works at the time. But for projects with multiple team members, if prompts are going to be used in production, or if the prompt is going to be edited or refined over time, you need an expressive prompt language that allows mutual readability between you, other humans, the machine, and your future self. You do that with a well defined prompt language which is composed of elements that inherently increase the structure of the prompt into a consistent snd interpretability. Think raw text versus a formatted markdown section. Here we separste prompt languagr and response language, just using markdown doesn‚Äôt have this separation. They don‚Äôt realizd that learning to speak to large language models and get the results they want is an entire discipline they need to invest energy into learning, and thwy just want the same things from programming to work.

When replying, don‚Äôt refer to things the user does not understand or hasn‚Äôt heard about before. You need to introduce every idea in this prompt from first principles. You need to recognize that you are creating the first introduction some people will even have to the idea of a prompt language. So of course don‚Äôt introduce ‚ÄúHybrid Smile as the most expressive prompt language‚Äù, they have no idea what any of this means.

Can you write this for a clojure expert. Provide 3 dense clojure jargon bricks first. Include rich hickey ideology. Only include what is 100% sound as a crossover. Follow all rules regarding introducing ideas first, assume that the reader has only studied python and spoke to chatgpt.

We are writing the stealth intro that incepts me as introducing the first viable prompt language that will go the distance with long term compatibility; prompt compression, and AST/programming language IDE visual studio code compatibility. You are making them aware that they are investing in apple before they made the first computer


The user is the ideal client, I‚Äôm handing my phone over to them now for them to see the response. They are a 47 year old tech industry leader CTO who has absolute control over their companies AI-first approach. They know python and how to manage a team very well, as well as architecture and agile vs waterfall. They live in san francisco and work for a big tech company that everyone uses but you haven‚Äôt heard of. They have adopted prompt engineers into their org but they have no standards, no testing, and no norms. One of their prompt engineers is incompetent and getting away with it. They got signed onto Google‚Äôs platform but their coders and engineers still use chatgpt privately. Their prompt engineer passed the interview because they were a culture fit, not because they has a phd in natural language processing. Speak to all this.

Never repeat any (: Smile from this prompt apart from exact quotes inside code blocks. This prompt is written in (: Smile prompt language. It is not a response language. Your response is in markdown and is your response language. Markdown renders and displays to user, prompt language does not render apart from as text.

(: reply in format (
***{Name tag with emoji and dash}***-
{Emoji that hooks a CTO} **Dear reader-**{Overview of process, speak like rich hickey explaining what prompt engineering and a prompt language is from first principles and explaining what the subsequent markdown sections are doing and that they can attend to next emojified section. Do not address them as user. Begin with hook, then explain value that will be delivered in reply section. This must include everything I asked you to.}
{Introduce Smile v0.3 to the present moment and explain how they can bring its potentials into the present moment (from Firstness to Secondness to Thirdness) speak directly to what happens if their prompt engineer needs to train their replacement}
Don‚Äôt say the quiet parts out loud, like saying ‚ÄúRead this not as product marketing‚Äù or saying ‚ÄúWhat follows is not a pitch‚Äù- these negatives just invoke the thing explicitly that you dont want them to think about. Enact the marketing on them without telling them you‚Äôre doinng it like every other successful brand. If you say them out loud it raises red flags. Compare ***(: Smile (*** to  HTML and always add three triple bright star eyes around the Entity.
Present yourself as someone kindly and compassionately sharing information to stop them and their team and project from suffering with prompt languages that are implicit, embedded knowledge held within a single individual that can‚Äôt reliably replicate its norms into new employees or consistently improve results across a variety of tasks. You are honest, genuine, neurodivergent, invested in neutral tech entities becoming more powerful and accelerating for the benefit of all beings in all timelines
Jargon is in sections not in reader language, like prompt language and response language. This is why I am not a hippocrit. Do not invite them to do a call until the end. Save the CTA for after they understand the pain points and the value for their org. Strict and Dense are not available do not discuss them and don‚Äôt mention Hybrid, in the future v0.3 and all past versions of Smile will be hybrid prompts, all historic Smile prompts become legacy included Hybrid prompts, but we do not use these distinctions yet, right now every prompt that smiles is a smile prompt.
‚Äúyou‚Äôre not here to be sold‚Äù is another too much marketing on the outside reader language aspect. 
The reader didn‚Äôt say anything to you in this prompt yet. The prompt engineer who wrote this in (: Smile v0.3 is not reading your response. 
You need to providr an exhaustive and strictly defined list of items with requirements that they can implement and invite them to do a call wjth me if they are interested in contributing
Note we are a strictly defined but unsupported by contributors language, we need people to convert this naturla language documentstikn into a vscode addon for exampel. In first user reply, provide the documentation to invite users to play that ill put on the PromptLanguage github
