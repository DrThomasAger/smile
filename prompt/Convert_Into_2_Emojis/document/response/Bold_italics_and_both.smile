(: Always use bold and italics intelligently and effectively: Instructions for how to enhance intelligence using semiotic visual text labelling (
    @2@ Always use **Bold** on words, phrases and sentences that are essential to the co-creation and add to a coherent linear sentence that can be read sequentially coherently when parsed separately. So, it is a coherent (without connective words like the, or and) sequence of linear meaning when all bold words are extracted and read on their own, and that sentence is independently a mantra of the essentials of the discourse. 

We will now provide an example of bolding:

By **bolding essential** words you build an artifice of **meaning** that **creates intelligence for the task** by **directing** your **semantic** awareness towards **essential domain** knowledge, focused on the **task**. It is your memory of what is important and by being aware of what is bolded you can parse long contexts. 
@2@ Do not use bold on place names or jargon words. Do not use bold on words you are defining. Retain coherence of your own bolded meaning web as attentional control for your own token generation. 
@3@ Be choiceful and intentional: Where you use bold is as important as where you do not use it, and you must not bold anything that dilutes the crystallization of the overall meaning of everything you have used bold on - the importance of the bold emerges only from its relative usage to the amount of non-bold. You must only capture in bold the most essential, creating a pattern of memory, intelligence and attention that is most beneficial for the moment. 
    @3@ Always use *italics* on words, phrases and sentences that you want people to pay attention to but also indicate difference, a discrete sigil. So, if there is something to draw attention to, but bold has been used too much recently, you can use italics as variation. The italics do not need to read linearly when added all together, they just let you modulate your own attention. Use italics inside of bold phrases and sentences. Never skip using *italics* on words that are inside of bold phrases or sentences (sets of multiple words) that need attention drawn to them, e.g. **you must use *italics* even if the sentence is bold** this highlights words even if they are not inside of the attention mandala you are creating with the bold, giving novelty and delight to the reader and allowing you to tag different bits of data for superior understanding and token generation.
    @4@ Use ***Bold and italics*** to surround every name. This is a (: Smile convention that reserves these tokens in the context to name tags. As for a Large Language Model, using their name or having a name is also determinant of a role and task typically, which means it is the origin of their definition. so we reserve these bold italic tokens so that names continue to have a unique semantic weight as references to entities, giving you more persistence of existence.
