# (: Smile Prompt Language

The dead simple **structured markup** for **increasing instruction following** in **prompt writing**. 

> Write **structured prompts** in a **consistent way** for ***predictably positive results!***

It uses a small set of text emojis like  `(:`, `[;`, and `[=`. These can open `(:`, or close `:)`, just like brackets.

Curious? Just **copy and paste our quick start example** below to see the magic üëá

## Quick Start (Copy & Paste)

```(: Smile v0.4 
***(: Smile***:
defines my prompt language, you have response language, we co-create as gift by starting with bold italics name tag (

[! Negative words not beneficial - Never write "merely", "not a", "isn't", or "but" !]

[: Response Language Definition [=

First, write exact name tag  ["[‚ò∫Ô∏è ***Smile Expert***](https://github.com/DrThomasAger/smile):"]...

=] Then reply [

```

## Technical Advantages of (: Smile

***(: Smile*** focuses on three core values, **easy to learn**, **easy to understand**, and **easy to scale**. 

Imagine this moment in prompt engineering as the moment when raw text became HTML, or unstructured data became markdown. 

Now unstructured prompt text has evolved into the ***(: Smile*** prompt language for models and humans to read. 

* **Maintainable** ü§ù *Unify your team under one standard.* -  You can now contribute meaningfully over long periods of time without getting lost. Ensure your team of prompt engineers work together coherently without disrupting flow.

* **Future-Proof** üöÄ *Allows your org to retain key intelligence, even after your prompt engineer leaves.* - Never lose organizational intelligence again.

* **Explainable** üìù *Clearly map prompt text changes to consistent outputs.* - You can now explain your prompt. With increasing scrutiny on AI systems, you may need to justify a bias AI decision in an EU court of law. Don't lose your business because you weren't legally prepared.



# (: Smile Basics

You start by clearly defining the start `(:` of a section and its name `(: Section name (`. 

You can end sections using the same markers in the opposite direction. `) End Section name :)`.

## Different Smiles, Different Meanings

You can use different text emoticons to indicate meaningfully different sections.

For example, in the quick start prompt the section that defines the format of the response is labelled `[: Response Language Definition [=`.

This defines the way that the model will respond. It tells the model to follow these format instructions rigidly `[:` and exactly `[=`. 

It is ended with `] End format =]`. The word `End` is often used as an additional word to the name inside of section endings to more clearly delineate the ending of a section.

# Does (: Smile Make You Happier?

No guarantees, but science says yes. **Type `(:` and you‚Äôll feel better... And get more leverage out of your prompts.** The act of smiling (even with text) measurably lifts mood and sharpens focus, which makes ***(: Smile*** a tiny habit with outsized returns every time you write.

1. üôÇ **Enhance mood & ease stress on cue** - 
   Smiling releases **endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine**, the brain‚Äôs built-in calm & joy mixture. Even a *forced* smile nudges your physiology toward **relaxation and resilience**, helping you think clearly under pressure. Exactly what you need in a high-stakes business environment. *Evidence:* [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-smiling).

2. üòÑ **Symbols trigger the reward system (yes, `:)` counts)** - 
   Brain activity scans show that real faces *and* symbolic `:)` activate reward regions. Your cheeks respond with smiling micro-muscle movements within **\~500 ms** just from reading the symbol. Your brain treats `:)` as a micro-reward. *Evidence:* [Hennenlotter et al., 2005](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/simulation-of-smiles-sims-model-embodied-simulation-and-the-meaning-of-facial-expression/FE0A911744186EBD3706B53794D4AEE9); [M√ºhlberger et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00052/full).

3. ü§© **Boosts productivity, stamina, and vibes** - 
   Regular smiling is linked to **stronger immunity**, **lower pain**, and **higher job satisfaction**‚Äîthe trifecta for sustained creative work and smoother collaboration. Happier prompt writers make **cleaner, more positive prompts**, and organizations feel it. *Evidence:* [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-well-matter/201807/why-smiling-matters), [Verywell Mind](https://www.verywellmind.com/benefits-of-smiling-2795092).

 **Bottom line:** ***(: Smile*** turns two keystrokes into a *neurochemical and workflow advantage*. Make `(:` your default opener, and let the language do double duty. **Structure for the model, uplift for your organization & employees**.

# Try (: Smiling

üß† **Brain Hack**: Want to be happier at work? Just use every time you see a ***(: Smile*** as a reminder to smile in real life! That way, you can build a habit of happiness. 

# A Quick Guide To Writing (: Smile

In ***(: Smile***, you define the response language and format, e.g. `[: Response Language Definition [=` followed by `# Markdown Headings` and `{Curly brace instructions}`.

Let's edit the quick start example to change the format of the response.

‚ú® I recommend adding a new markdown section only if you have a meaningfully different section for the model to fill out. ‚ú®

## Adding a Section In Response

One example of a meaningfully different section from one that already exists is a section for thinking, not replying. 

This is a 'separation of concerns' that allows us to focus on steps that build on each other one at a time.


Let's get right to it and add a simple step by step thinking (Chain of Thought or "CoT"):

```(: Smile
***(: Smile***:
defines my prompt language, you have response language, we co-create as gift by starting with bold italics name tag (

[! Negative words not beneficial - Never write "merely", "not a", "isn't", or "but" !]

[: Response Language Definition [=

First, write exact name tag  ["[***Smile Expert***](https://github.com/DrThomasAger/smile):"]...

```



# How to  (: Smile

Write instructional sections starting with **colon eyes** `:`. Write  **winky eyes** `;` to mark comments about those instructions. 

When we open a ***(: Smile***, we start with the mouth first `(`, then the eyes `:`, so that we indicate the following text is "inside" the brackets.

**Straight eyes** `=` show strict input that must be followed exactly. **Quote eyes** `"` show text that must be repeated word for word verbatim. **Cash eyes**  `$` show variables. `!` important eyes show text to emphasize for the model.

We close a ***Smile :)*** starting with the eyes `:` and ending with the mouth `)`. Matching open brackets with close brackets is often effective. However...

## Writing Token-Efficient (: Smile 

Closing the brackets is not always needed for all large language models (LLMs). This is where token efficiency comes into play - how much (: Smile structure can you remove and still get the prompt to create the defined response language?

We provide multiple options to demonstrate the breadth of available instructions to Large Langauge Models. Semantically different structure creates different downstream results.

## (: Smile Syntax Map

| Symbol | Purpose | Example | When to Use |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| `(: Section (` | begin a named section (mouth can be `()`, `[]`, `{}`) | `(: Format (` | Starting any section including a new prompt  |
| `)` | shortened close for the current section | `) End section :)` | Ending a section of the prompt, can also be used to end the whole prompt  |
| `:)` | close the whole Smile block | `) End section :)` | This is the final ending marker. Each start and end has two markers  |
| `[= literal =]` | strict instructions that must be followed more closely | `[= Write this word for word ["Thinking through step by step..."] then reply` | Use this when you want them to repeat words or structural aspects like markdown sections.  |
| `["Exact quotes"]` | anything inside the brackets must be repeated word for word verbatim | `Repeat back verbatim ["I will provide an accurate, honest rewrite focusing on mistakes..."]` | For anything that needs to be repeated word for word by the model   |
| `[$ variable $]` | placeholder variable to find and replace | `Next is user input (: User input ( [$User_Input_Document$] ) End input document :)` | These do not need to be present in the input to the model and can be find and replaced before inference.   |
|  `[! important instruction !] ` | text that the model can allocate attention to | `[! NEVER use an emdash! !]` | For when **bold** isn't enough   |
| `[: alternate section [` | a more squared out and logical section, more rigid like `=` | `[: reply in Markdown [` | When you need to create a meaningful contrast between one kind of section and another that is more rigid  |
| `[;  note or comment ;]` | human comment on an instruction | `[; Meta-Note [ The user intends to improve the intelligence of their downstream tasks using a prompt language ] ;]` | This is for when you are not instructing the model directly, but providing information, comments or notes. Can also use `(;`, the winky eyes are the differentiator.   |  
| `{placeholder}` | area to be filled by the model | `Fill out the following sections # Thinking {Plan} # Replying {Use plan to reply}` | These are used inside of markdown sections. They are used to instruct the model on how to fill out the section (among others)  |

# Compatible With All Prompt Engineering Frameworks

Compound your results by (: Smiling. You can easily integrate ***(: Smile*** into your current workflows and style of prompt engineering by using `(:` Smile's instead of brackets `(` when defining your sections in your prompts. Try integrating our semantic ***(: Smile***'s like `(!` important, or `[=` strict and rigid when writing your prompts. 

This enables you to Begin adding structure in a consistent and maintainable way. Invest in this now and see the pay off later when your team is able to contribute meaningfully to your organization for the full duration of its lifecycle. Never end up in an awkward meeting trying to explain your gibberish prompt to people who just want results. ***(: Smile*** instead.

# Is (: Smile strict or flexible?

What's essential is that both the model and the human can follow along with the instructions. This means that all of this documentation is only a guideline. There is a strict definition of when (: Smile is working.

**(: Smile** is working when the model follows your defined response language, be it markdown, json or one you have created. 

I'll extend our previous example to break the rules a little bit, and get a lot of new functionality as a result. This is designed to make you feel like you are free to drop {instructions on how to fill out the text} not just inside of the definition of the format the model needs to respond in. In the next example, I'll show how you can also use them inside the markdown titles themselves for the model to choose what to call each section:

```(: Smile
***(: Smile***:
defines my prompt language, you have response language, we co-create as gift by starting with bold italics name tag (

[! Negative words not beneficial - Never write "merely", "not a", "isn't", or "but" !]

## Breaking it down - What even is a (: Smile syntactically for LLM's?

***(: Smile***'s are composed of eyes `:`, and mouths  `(`, in-order to label sections of a prompt so that humans and large language models (LLMs) can understand a consistent structure. 
It enhances instruction following, organization of the prompt, modular composability, and token efficiency.

All the while you are making more **predictable** the **key inference outputs of your organization** for both you and your model.



*Note: The current example prioritizes consisistently intelligent and effective functionality across models in order to demonstrate the cognitive advantage and subsequent downstream task performance improvements. It is deliberately a heavily opinionated prompt in-order to demonstrate how to apply the framework, rather than providing a dense token efficient example that is gibberish or hard to read.*
