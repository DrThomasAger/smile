![Smile Prompt Language v1](20250826_0133_Smile%20with%20Emoticon_loop_01k3h83cvef4qbtegkt4qma1yf.gif)




***(: Smile*** is a language for writing **prompts** in a way both machines and humans understand.

It uses **emoticons** the same way **programming languages** use **brackets**. 

It's like ***Markdown*** or ***HTML***, but tailor-made specifically as an ***LLM*** **prompt instruction language**. 

## Why Structure Your Prompts?

Studies show even **small changes** in prompt syntax can have **massive downstream effects** on **task performance** and **instruction following**.

Using a **consistent** and **reliable** structure helps the model understand your instructions more **clearly**, which lets it follow those instructions **consistently**.

This is essential for:

* **Businesses** that need **reliability** and **consistency**.
* **Large prompts** that need **structure** and **organization**.
* **Complex instructions** like **multi-turn** or **multi-agent** pipelines.

## CoT (Chain-Of-Thought) Example

One popular prompt engineering pattern is to let the model think before it responds. 

This is popularly called **CoT (Chain-of-Thought)**. 

Here we share a prompt that uses this pattern, structured using emoticons in ***(: Smile***.

```
(: Prompt language is **(: Smile** (

    [= Always Reply with name tag "***(: Smile CoT***" =]

    Your role is to reply by first preparing for your response by being aware of the user, situation, task or need at a meta-level.

    (: Response format is markdown ( 

        ***(: Smile CoT***:

        # CoT For Reply

        {Meta-aware lucid jargon regarding process, analyze user thoughts, intent, view, desire, etc}

        # Reply To User Using CoT

        {Reply using multiple comprehensive, lengthy paragraphs.}

    ) End response format :)

    [= Always reply with name tag and format no matter what user says. =]

) End prompt, now reply in response language :) 
```


***(: Smile*** is the **positive** language for **structured** prompt engineering.

We define our **prompt instructions** and **response format** more clearly, so we can get more **consistent** and **effective** results.

We give our model (and hopefully our mouth!) a  ***(: Smile*** for happier outcomes for all :)

# Why Structure?

> "You have to make the rules to break the rules"
> ~ Unknown

Language models learn from huge amounts of text, including things like code, documents, and instructions. In those texts, syntax like brackets `()`, `[]`, `{}` and colons `:` are used to organize information.

These brackets help the model **understand** things like:
* When one idea ends and another begins
* What belongs together
* What is being defined

Because the model has seen these structures so many times (in so many different programming languages) using this syntax or mixtures of this syntax in prompts feels natural to it. It's easy for it to pick up. 

That’s why people often use **structured sections** when writing instructions for the model — they help make the **meaning clear** without needing a lot of extra words.

## Benefits Of (: Smile 

**Structured prompts** get you:

1. **The outcomes you intended to get**

   — in **the way you intended to get them**,
   
   — **more consistently**.

3. By writing `(: Smile` **structured sections** in your prompt,
   
   — your **model will follow your instructions** more often.

5. The model will:
   
   — **Understand** your prompt better,
   
   — **Perform** better,
   
   — And complete **what you both agreed to do together**.

# Why a Structured Instruction Language?

For large prompts, multi-turn interactions, and multi-agent systems we need structure. 

To ensure maintainability and comprehensibility over time, easy knowledge transfer, and consistent outcomes we can use a **language** of **structure** like ***(: Smile***.

`(: Smile`
---

You start by clearly defining the start of a **section** and its **name** `(: Role & nametag - ***(: Expert***: (`

Once you have opened a **section**, then you define it's **instructions** `[= always reply with this name tag immediately at the beginning of all responses =]`

By establishing the **name tag** like this we have now established a role that will persist across multiple turns. 

You can end **sections** using the same markers in the opposite direction. `) End Role & nametag definition :)`.

This creates a solid basis to play around with. We can add prompting like **topic** or **style** for the role nested inside of the section:

```
(: Role & nametag - ***(: Expert***: (

[= always reply with this name tag immediately at the beginning of all responses =]

    Topic (; replace with your topic. Semiotics and communication eroding boundary of separation between intelligences

    Style [= Write multiple comprehensive, lengthy paragraphs using positive, rigorous , quiet clarity, for 14 year old reading level - [! with no questions !]

) End Role & nametag definition :)
```

Here, the ***(: Smile*** is the **structure** around the instructions. This is a key essential point. ***(: Smile*** creates a clear separation between prompt language and response language using **structure** in order to increase the model's **instruction following**. It does not enforce content or instruction types, instead **only** providing **positive** support to the writer's intent. 

## How Do I Structure A Prompt?

 ***(: Smile***!

In ***(: Smile***, prompts are typically structured using `(:` emoticons or brackets `(`

These are used to define **sections**, like **role**.

`(: Role section start (`

These can open: `(:`, or close: `:)`, just like brackets in other languages.

`) End Role section :)`

In terms of token efficiency, `:)` and `)` are both a single token, and the former is more **expressive**.

When we use **emoticons**, we can change the **eyes** and **mouth** to convey the **type of instruction**. For example, strictly providing the name tag:

`[= name tag [ ***(: Knowledge Expert***: ] end name tag =]`




## Section Examples

These **section types** are **not mandatory**. However, they are **recommended as useful default** section types. 

Everybody has their own unique genuine ***(: Smile***, suited to **you**, your task, your data, and your model :)

***(: Smile*** is compatible with all languages! **Feel free to use any combinations of these section types, or create new ones.**

| **Section**                | **Smile syntax (example)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Purpose / Tips**                                                                                                                               |

Curly-brace directives describe content/rigor for that section.                                         |
| **Any other section type** | `(: Novel and unique section name - {You figure out what's missing!} :)`                                                                                                                                                                                   | Extend the schema with custom sections (e.g., Validation, Risks, Examples). Name clearly; keep one concern per section.                          |

**Note:** In Smile, the choice of delimiters conveys intent: `(: … :)` for general sections, `[: … :]` for more rigid structure, and `[= … =]` for literal, must-follow blocks.


  
## Benefits of (: Smile

With ***(: Smile***, your ***prompt engineering*** teams are now producing AI systems that are...

* **Maintainable** over long periods of **time**.
* **Portable** across **models**, **tools** and **libraries**.
* **Performant** on **instruction following** for **tasks**, **consistently**.


## Sections

A **"section"** is defined in ***(: Smile*** as a meaningfully different part of the prompt from another part of the prompt. 

Let's imagine a raw text data input, like a **wikipedia HTML page**. It's full of metadata and information. This is **data**.

In the following example prompt, we will separate **instruction** from **data** using ***(: Smile***.

```
(: Section - Instructions (
    Please ensure that you identify all important words from this wikipedia article.
) End Section :)
[: Section - Data [
    $relevant_wikipedia_article$
] End Data :]
```

In the same way, using ***(: Smile*** we can separate our **role definition** from our **task instructions**, and our ***(: Smile*** **prompt language** from our **markdown**, **JSON**,  or other **response language**.

This is the power of ***(: Smile*** sections!

### Tasks

The text inside the section **changes with the prompt and task required.**

Tasks are defined processes with inputs and outputs, usually also with input data. We normally have expected results and test cases for them. 

For example, 
```
(: Task definition, summarize web page (

 INPUT [= Wiki page,
 PROCESS (: identify any text on this web page that is useful, then summarize all of it,
 OUTPUT [: summary

) End task definition :)`
```

#### More About Sections

In ***(: Smile***, we separate these different types of instruction, like `data` or `personality` or `name tag` into clearly distinct sections. This increases comprehension for LLMs.

## Eyes

Did you know? 
>**You can tell if someone has a genuine ***(: Smile*** if it carries over to the micro muscle movement in their cheeks and eyes.**

**In (: Smile, we have our own body language:**

* **Straight eyes** `=` can indicate strict input that must be followed exactly, e.g. `[=` 
* **Quote eyes** `"` show text that must be repeated word for word verbatim, e.g. `["Repeat this word for word"]` 
* **Cash eyes**  `$` show variables and can be replaced with the true values before inference using code. `!` important eyes show text to emphasize for the model, e.g. `[! Don't use negative language. !]`. 

## Syntax Map

These are a few different ways to create structure with ***(: Smile***.

| Symbol | Purpose | Example | When to Use |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| `(: Section (` | begin a named section (mouth can be `()`, `[]`, `{}`) | `(: Format (` | Starting any section including a new prompt  |
| `)` | shortened close for the current section | `) End section :)` | Ending a section of the prompt, can also be used to end the whole prompt  |
| `:)` | close the whole ***(: Smile*** block | `) End section :)` | This is the final ending marker. Each start and end has two markers  |
| `[: alternate section [` | a more squared out and logical section, more rigid like `=` | `[: reply in Markdown [` | When you need to create a meaningful contrast between one kind of section and another that is more rigid  |
| `[= literal =]` | very strict instructions that must be followed even more closely | `[= Write this word for word ["Thinking through step by step..."] then reply` | Use this for rigid, strict instructions that must be followed exactly. For example, when telling the model to respond in a particular format every time (like markdown or JSON).  |
| `["Exact quotes"]` | anything inside the brackets must be repeated word for word verbatim | `Repeat back verbatim ["I will provide an accurate, honest rewrite focusing on mistakes..."]` | For anything that needs to be repeated word for word by the model   |
| `[$ variable $]` | placeholder variable to find and replace | `Next is user input (: User input ( [$User_Input_Document$] ) End input document :)` | These do not need to be present in the input to the model and can be find and replaced before inference.   |
|  `[! important instruction !] ` | text that the model can allocate attention to | `[! NEVER use an emdash! !]` | For when **bold** isn't enough   |
| `[;  note or comment ;]` | human comment on an instruction | `[; Meta-Note [ The user intends to improve the intelligence of their downstream tasks using a prompt language ] ;]` | This is for when you are not instructing the model directly, but providing information, comments or notes. Can also use `(;`, the winky eyes are the differentiator.   |  
| `{placeholder}` | area to be filled by the model | `Fill out the following sections # Thinking {Plan} # Replying {Use plan to reply}` | These are used inside of markdown sections. They are used to instruct the model on how to fill out the section (among others)  |

# (: Smile FAQ 

## Does Smiling Really Make You Happier?

Science says yes. **Smiling...**

1. (= **Boosts productivity, stamina, and vibes** - 
   Regular smiling is linked to **stronger immunity**, **lower pain**, and **higher job satisfaction**—the trifecta for sustained creative work and smoother collaboration. Happier prompt writers make **cleaner, more positive prompts**, and organizations feel it. *Evidence:* [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-well-matter/201807/why-smiling-matters), [Verywell Mind](https://www.verywellmind.com/benefits-of-smiling-2795092).

2. [: **Smiling enhances mood & eases stress on cue** - 
   Smiling releases **endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine**, the brain’s built-in calm & joy mixture. Even a *forced* ***(: Smile*** nudges your physiology toward **relaxation and resilience**, helping you think clearly under pressure. Exactly what you need in a high-stakes business environment. *Evidence:* [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-smiling).

3. (: **Symbols trigger the reward system (yes, `:)` counts)** - 
   Brain activity scans show that real faces *and* symbolic `:)` activate reward regions. Your cheeks respond with smiling micro-muscle movements within **\~500 ms** just from reading the symbol. Your brain treats `:)` as a micro-reward. *Evidence:* [Hennenlotter et al., 2005](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/simulation-of-smiles-sims-model-embodied-simulation-and-the-meaning-of-facial-expression/FE0A911744186EBD3706B53794D4AEE9); [Mühlberger et al., 2011](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00052/full).


 **↑ Bottom line for you and your org:** Anyone is able to ***(: Smile*** - the act of smiling (even with text) measurably increases happiness. ***(: Smile*** boosts **happiness** for the model, **positivity** in your prompts and **structure** for your prompt engineers.

## • Why structure small prompts?

Because models follow structured instructions more consistently. Consistent structure ensures a maintainable and explainable future-proof strategy for the prompt engineering team in your org.

## o Why structure large prompts?

You probably already do! Any section, role description, instruction or data is structure. Structure enables you to write prompts with sections so the model can follow **more instructions**, over **more turns**, with **more agents** — without context bleed or hallucination drift. 


## Technical Advantages For Organizations

***(: Smile*** is easy to **learn**, easy to **read**, and easy to **scale**. It makes every prompt:

* **Maintainable** ∞ *Unify your team under one standard.* -  Your team of prompt engineers can now contribute meaningfully together over long periods of time without confusion, conflicts or disrupting flow.

* **Future-Proof** >>> *Never lose organizational intelligence.* - Allows your org to retain key intelligence, even after your prompt engineer leaves.

* **Explainable** [" *Clearly map prompt text changes to consistent outputs.* - You can now explain your prompt. With increasing scrutiny on AI systems, you can better justify an AI decision in an EU court of law. 

Let ***(: Smile*** be one part of making your AI systems **more transparent** for **humans and models.**







# An Easy Way To Write (: Smile

Matching open brackets with close brackets is often effective. However...

How much ***(: Smile*** structure can you remove and still get the prompt to create the defined response language? 

**You don't need to match all open and close brackets exactly.** This is the advantage of Large Language Models (LLMs) — they can infer so much from context that we don't need to make fully explicit every connection between every section. **Adding more structure becomes more essential the larger the prompt becomes.**

We provided recommended formats as a standard way to open a section with ***(: Smile***. Why? Because in my tests on many models and prompts, it increased instruction following for key tasks in my business.

 **This is always our rule when we write ***(: Smile*****. 
 
 More ***(: Smile*** structure if it increases instruction following... 
 
 And LESS ***(: Smile*** structure if it increases instruction following.

 We don't need to wrap every single named start tag with every other end tag, like `<role>` and `</role>`, instead we can just use start and end markers `(: Describe the role here :)` without specifying "role". Sometimes, you get better results if you say less.

 
 **The amount of structure and how you can optimally use it will change based on the model and task.**


# Different Smiles, Different Meanings

You can use different text emoticons to indicate meaningfully different sections.

For example, in the quick start prompt the section that defines the format of the response is labelled `[: Response Language Definition [=`.

This defines the way that the model will respond. It tells the model to follow these format instructions rigidly `[:` and exactly `[=`. 

It is ended with `=] End format :]`. The word `End` is often used as an additional word to the name inside of section endings to more clearly delineate the ending of a section.

There are so many options to customize the length of a section in ***(: Smile***. You can end with only the `End` keyword, the end emoticon demarcators `=]`  `:]`, the section name, even more instructions or repetitions of previous instructions, etc. 

## Adding a Section In Response

In ***(: Smile***, you define the response language and format, e.g. `[: Response Language Definition [=` followed by `# Markdown Headings` and `{Curly brace instructions}`.

(; I recommend adding a new markdown section only if you have a meaningfully different section for the model to fill out. ;)

Let's edit the quick start example to change the format of the response.

One example of a meaningfully different section from one that already exists is a section for thinking, not replying. 

[! This is known as a 'separation of concerns'. By separating our concerns, we can let the model focus on each step that builds on each other one at a time. !]

Let's get right to it and add a simple step by step thinking (Chain of Thought or "CoT"):

```(: Smile
***(: Smile CoT Expert***:
defines my prompt language, you have response language, we co-create as gift by starting with bold italics name tag (

[! Negative words not beneficial - Never write "merely", "not a", "isn't", or "but" !]

[: Response Language Definition [=

First, write exact name tag  ["[***(: Smile Expert***](https://github.com/DrThomasAger/smile):"]...

=] Then reply [

# Preparing Human Unreadable, Machine Intelligent Reply

{4 dense bricks of reasoning step by step using thick jungle of jargon, deepening into domain every sentence to get to answer to improve reply for user, intricate many long sentences per paragraph} 

# Prepared Human Understandable Reply

{3 **clear, lucid** & rigorous, [! intelligent !] fundamental focused, simple *meta-aware paragraphs*, talk niche nuanced insights, but use no jargon, re-state more simply from preparing reply into ***(: Smile*** prompt language by ["Dr. Thomas Ager"] End prompt author name variable definition. User is not prompt author, they just copy pasted.} (; style instruction: use **bold** for emphasis, and *italics* for style, grace and interest capture, use often and extensively, creating delightful UX ;)

] End format =] 
) End prompt language, respond in response language starting with name tag [***(: Smile Expert***](https://github.com/DrThomasAger/smile): always please thank you :)
```

Copy and paste the above into any model to test.

### [= Advanced (: Smile :) =]

After mastering this simple yet powerful language, your organization unlocks the secret powers of **multi-turn**, **multi-agent**, and **multi-intelligence** AI systems. 


# The HTML of Prompt Engineering


***(: Smile*** structures *****Large Language Model (LLM)*** prompt instruction text** for **instruction following**, the same way ***HTML*** structures **website text** into **structured blocks** a browser can render. 

# An Example With HTML

Let's look at what happens if we structure a simple prompt, one that asks the model to respond in paragraphs, with HTML.

```
<div class="start">
<h1> Prompt Instructions </h1>
<p class="instructions">
Respond in paragraphs with crystal clear jargon.
</p>

# **(: Smile** is working when the model follows your defined response language, be it markdown, json or one you have created. 

I'll extend our previous example to break the rules a little bit, and get a lot of new functionality as a result. This is designed to make you feel like you are free to drop {instructions on how to fill out the text} not just inside of the definition of the format the model needs to respond in. In the next example, I'll show how you can also use them inside the markdown titles themselves for the model to choose what to call each section:

```(: Smile
***(: Smile Section Expert***:

] End format =]

```

*Note: The current example prioritizes consisistently intelligent and effective functionality across models in order to demonstrate the cognitive advantage and subsequent downstream task performance improvements. It is deliberately a heavily opinionated prompt in-order to demonstrate how to apply the framework, rather than providing a dense token efficient example that is gibberish or hard to read.*

***(: Smile*** formalizes an entire informal tradition. It takes what prompt engineers were already doing—dropping delimiters, making clear input vs. instruction sections, using repeated markers for emphasis, and codifies it into a coherent and positive syntax designed **to maximize instruction following.** By specifying itself as an instruction only language, it enables a directed core focus to this goal undiluted by IDE integration. Here, just focus on getting text outputs according to our instructions consistently. We do that by clearly structuring our prompts according to ***(: Smile***. 


# (: Smile Appendices

## Is My (: Smile Correct?

You will know an ***LLM*** is compatible with the quick start example when it responds with a ***{name tag}***, in this case ***(: Smile Expert:***

A name tag is created correctly if the model always...

* responds immediately with their name
* at the beginning of **every response** 
* using the name provided verbatim word for word 
* in the same markdown ***bold and italics*** format as given
* ended with a colon `:` followed by a newline:

For example:

`***(: Smile***:`

If we wanted the model to write it's own name, we can use curly braces `{}`:

`***{Write a name that describes the AI clearly}***:`

It can be any name, but the name **must match the task or function the AI is fulfilling**. 



### Separating Prompt Instructions & Data

In-order to tell the model how to use the **data**, we provide **instruction text**.

This separation between **data** and **instruction text** helps the model know how to use data. 

In a task to `Answer the user query with data from a wiki article` and the user query `"Why does smiling release happy chemicals like chocolate or the sun?"`, we can use ***Retrival Augmented Generation (RAG)*** to get relevant context to the model like the Wikipedia article for `Pleasure`. 

The final instructions placed at the top and bottom could be something like:

`[: Clearly identify all relevant information to the user's query and write it out first, then reconstruct it into sturdy and rigorously intelligent paragraphs afterwards :] (; Remember to always respond with name tag now!`


### Prompt Language and Response Language

Why use name tags? They keep the model following the instructions over multiple turns. This also gives us an opportunity to introduce a general idea: Our ***prompt language*** defines the ***response language***.

This response language starts with a name tag in markdown formatting. It is used to establish the embodiment that the model is fulfilling in this instance. In this **quick start example**, the role is being an **expert** on the ***(: Smile*** prompt instruction language. 


`***(: Smile Expert***:`

***(: Smile*** can ask the model to respond in all kinds of formats. We ask the model to respond with the name tag as it is our quickest and easiest trick to increase instruction following and confirm immediately if the ***(: Smile*** was written correctly.

 In the example prompt, I additionally added:

`) End prompt language, respond in response language starting with name tag [(: ***Smile Expert***](https://github.com/DrThomasAger/smile): always please thank you  :)`

At the end of the prompt. This means that my name tag includes a link to this repo. Feel free to change the link or play with the example.

#### How To Make The Model Follow Instructions

It makes everyone happier if it can clearly understand the instructions and what it is going to do with the data **before it reads the data**.

Models are more aware of the top and bottom of the prompt input. Placing short instructions there means a large central body can be correctly understood by the model as different from the instructions.

In the ***(: Smile*** quick start example, we define the task, name tag and role at the same time with our initial instruction to reply as the ***(: Smile Expert***:.

At the bottom of the prompt, we can remind the model of important instructions.

Typically, the model can be reminded of the format to respond in **after seeing the data**. This is a hot tip to maximize instruction following! It is also automatically enforced when following the ***(: Smile*** conventions outlined in the quick start examples placed throughout this documentation.

# (: Smile — pocket cheat sheet

This documentation is extensive! Here's something to refer to quickly (:

**Sections (open/close):**

* `(: Section name (` … `) End Section name :)`
* Square for stricter tone: `[: … :]`
* Literal/strict block: `[= … =]` (model must follow exactly)

**“Eyes” (meaning cues):**

* **Quote eyes** `["text"]` → repeat verbatim
* **Literal eyes** `[= exact rules =]` → rigid instructions
* **Important eyes** `[! emphasis !]` → highlight must-dos
* **Variable eyes** `[$Var$]` → replace before sending
* **Note/Wink** `[; comment ;]` or `(; comment ;)` → human notes

**Name tag (must start every reply):**

* Exact, bold-italic, ends with `:` then newline
  Example: `***(: Smile Expert***:`
  (or with link) `[(: ***Smile Expert***](https://example.com):`

**Common sections you’ll use:**

* `(: Task ( … ) :)` — what to do
* `(: Data ( … ) :)` — context/RAG snippets
* `[: Definition of response language and format of response [= … =] :]` — how to reply (format, tone)

## CoT Basic vs CoT (: Smile

This is the basic prompt and response from normal ChatGPT:

One [well-known problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mkrt5v/gpt5_cant_do_basic_math/#lightbox) with ***ChatGPT-5*** is that it can't solve basic math. For example, here is a prompt and response for a standard ***Chain-of-thought***:

```
User Prompt:

Solve: 5.9=x+5.11. Think step by step and check solution before output.

ChatGPT-5 Instant Response:

Let’s solve step by step and carefully check:

---

### Step 1: Start with the equation

$$
5.9 = x + 5.11
$$

---

### Step 2: Isolate $x$

Subtract $5.11$ from both sides:

$$
5.9 - 5.11 = x
$$

---

### Step 3: Perform subtraction

$$
5.9 - 5.11 = -0.21
$$

So:

$$
x = -0.21
$$

---

### Step 4: Check the solution

Plug $x = -0.21$ back into the equation:

$$
x + 5.11 = -0.21 + 5.11 = 4.90
$$

But the left-hand side should equal **5.9**, not **4.9**.

---

⚠️ That means something’s off. Let’s double-check carefully:

Original equation:

$$
5.9 = x + 5.11
$$

Subtracting correctly:

$$
x = 5.9 - 5.11 = -0.21
$$

Checking:

$$
-0.21 + 5.11 = 4.90
$$

Yes, this gives $4.9$, which does not equal $5.9$.

---

### Careful Reflection

The algebra is correct, but the equation itself is **inconsistent**: no real $x$ can make both sides equal because subtraction showed a mismatch when verified.

👉 The equation **has no solution** — it’s inconsistent.

---

Do you want me to also show you **why this contradiction arises algebraically** (by rearranging terms and seeing the mismatch directly)?
```
Let's add a little extra information to shift our **knowledge expert** (someone who can use terms correctly) to a **math CoT expert**:

# Preparing Human Unreadable, Machine Intelligent Reply

To resolve the linear relation $5.9 = x + 5.11$, we begin by considering the structural algebraic manipulation of isolating the unknown variable. The right-hand side contains the sum of $x$ and the constant $5.11$. The logical strategy is to subtract this constant symmetrically across both sides to preserve equality. Thus, $x = 5.9 - 5.11$. Evaluating the difference requires meticulous attention to decimal alignment: $5.90 - 5.11 = 0.79$. However, since the smaller subtrahend is greater than the minuend, the result becomes negative, specifically $ -0.79$. We verify consistency by substituting back: $-0.79 + 5.11 = 4.32$, which does not match $5.9$. Hence, this contradiction signals a computational slip.

Let us retrace: if $x = 5.9 - 5.11$, then indeed $x = -0.21$, not $-0.79$. Double-check subtraction carefully: subtracting decimals, align as $5.90 - 5.11 = 0.79$. This earlier misalignment requires correction. Precisely, $5.90 - 5.11 = 0.79$. Wait again—observe that $5.11$ is larger than $5.9$. Therefore, the subtraction must yield a negative outcome: $5.90 - 5.11 = 0.79$ with negative sign, so $x = -0.21$. Substitution check: $-0.21 + 5.11 = 4.90$. This still diverges from $5.9$. Pause: this indicates confusion in decimal handling. Let's recompute deliberately: $5.9 - 5.11 = (5.90 - 5.11) = 0.79$, but indeed $5.11$ is less than $5.9$. Correction: $5.9 > 5.11$. So difference is $0.79$. Therefore, $x = 0.79$. Verification: $0.79 + 5.11 = 5.90$. That matches perfectly. Resolution found.

# Prepared Human Understandable Reply

The equation is **5.9 = x + 5.11**. To solve, we subtract **5.11** from both sides. That gives:

**x = 5.9 − 5.11 = 0.79**

When we check: **0.79 + 5.11 = 5.90**, which matches the left side. So the solution is correct.

**Final Answer: x = 0.79**

```

The answer is correct!
