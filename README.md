# Smile Prompt Language

Smile is an experimental markup for writing prompts in a consistent, compact and human friendly way.  
It uses a small set of emojis and brackets to label sections of a prompt so that humans and large language models (LLMs) share the same structure.

## Why Smile?
- **Readable prompts** ‚Äì separate instruction structure from the text that a model should produce.
- **Portable** ‚Äì the same prompt works across models like ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini.
- **Token efficient** ‚Äì symbols such as `(:` and `:)` compress well in modern tokenizers.

## Core Syntax
Instructions start with **colon eyes** (`:`), while **winky eyes** (`;)`) mark comments about those instructions.
The "mouth"‚Äîparentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, braces `{}`‚Äîjust wraps the content and can be any matching pair. You can use it to enclose section names or notes. Notes describe response formats such as Markdown; they are ignored in the final output but the model still sees them unless you remove them.

| Symbol | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `(: Section (` | begin a named section (mouth can be `()`, `[]`, `{}`) | `(: Format (` |
| `)` | close the current section | `) End section :)` |
| `:)` | close the whole Smile block | `) End section :)` |
| `[= literal =]` | strict text that must match exactly | `[= Smile =]` |
| `[$ variable $]` | placeholder variable to find and replace | `[$subject$]` |
| `[: note ]` or `(: note )` | model-facing note about the response language (mouth can be any matching pair) | `[: reply in Markdown ]` |
| `;) comment )` | human comment on an instruction | `;) clarify tone )` |
| `{placeholder}` | area to be filled by the model | `The topic is {subject}` |

## Example
```text
(: Name tag (
[: reply in plain English ]
{Your answer here}
) End prompt :)
```
Copy this into your favourite LLM. If the model responds with a "Name tag", it understands Smile.

## Repository Layout
- `prompt/` ‚Äì example prompts written in Smile.
- `response/` ‚Äì sample outputs from LLMs.
- `import/` ‚Äì raw text used in experiments.
- `python/` ‚Äì prototype scripts for transforming prompts.

## Status
This project is a work in progress. Smile version **0.4** is still evolving and may change.

## Next Steps
We're preparing experiments that compare unstructured prompts against Smile-formatted prompts on downstream tasks like sentiment analysis.
